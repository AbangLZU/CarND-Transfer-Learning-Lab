# Transfer Learning Lab

In this lab, you will continue exploring transfer learning. You've already explored feature extraction with AlexNet and TensorFlow. Next, you will use Keras to explore feature extraction with the VGG, Inception and ResNet architectures. The models you will use were trained for days or weeks on the ImageNet dataset. Thus, the weights escapsulate higher-level features learned from thousands of classes.

We'll use two datasets in this lab:

1. German Traffic Sign Dataset
2. Cifar10

How will the pretrained model perform on the new datasets?
